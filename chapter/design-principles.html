            After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, 
            this section elaborates on specific ways to approach the design process.

        <h2> Community-Centered Design </h2>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other (PREECES, 2004, P. 3FF).
             According to Preece, developing online communities is different from designing software as software, once shipped, is 
             stable and does not change until the next update while online communities develop and change through dynamic 
             interactions. It is first and foremost a social experience that changes according to who is participating, the number of 
             people involved, and the type of discussion that takes place (IBID., P.4). For example, the dynamics between new and 
             long-established communities differ notably. While the software might not change drastically, social interactions will 
             adapt according to the growth of the community. This social adaption is called “sociability” (IBID.).

            In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes. Therefore, crucial to 
            not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability. Therefore, knowledge from different disciplines 
            such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, as well as user-centered design is required (IBID.). In participatory 
            community-centered design methodology (→ FIG. 07), members of the community are involved in the design process from the 
            beginning. In community-centered design, six phases are each followed by an evaluation period and iterations based on the 
            findings.
